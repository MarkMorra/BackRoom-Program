Introduction:
This is the readme.txt file for the program Shoppers Drug Mart Back Room Program. This software was created for employees of any rank in the backroom of a Shopper's Drug Mart Store.

Instructions:
The program that is executed is called ShoppersDrugMartBackRoomProgramV0.01.exe. The application can be located in C:\Users\(PC Name)\source\repos\Shoppers Drug Mart Back Room Program\ShoppersDrugMartBackRoomProgramV0.01\x64\Debug. It is recommended to create a shortcut to this application to avoid a tedious search for the executable file. The source code for this program, ShoppersDrugMartBackRoomProgramV0.01.sln, can be accessed in the same folder as this readme.txt file. The .dat and .txt files for the user, log and item database can be accessed in C:\Users\Michiko\source\repos\Shoppers Drug Mart Back Room Program\ShoppersDrugMartBackRoomProgramV0.01\ShoppersDrugMartBackRoomProgramV0.01\data. However, all data in the user, log and item database are automatically encrypted and therefore cannot be read directly from the source files. It is recommended and intended for users to log in to their account in order to access these databases.

How to Log On:
When the program is run for the first time or directly after the user database has been reset, the program will ask the user to enter a new username and password after selecting the log in option. This first account in the user database is automatically set as the admin account and has access to every permission in the program. From here, the admin can add new users through one of their options and create new accounts with varying permissions. It is recommended to record one's personal username and password.
